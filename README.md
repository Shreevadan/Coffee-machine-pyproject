# Coffee-machine-pyproject
This project involves the working of a coffee machine using python methods and functions.The machine works with typical products: coffee, milk, sugar, and plastic cups; if it runs out of something, it shows a notification. You can get three types of coffee: espresso, cappuccino, and latte. Since nothingâ€™s for free, it also collects the money.
